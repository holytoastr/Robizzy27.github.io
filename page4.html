      <p>
        At least my bias has some basis in that I feel the European teams unfairly dominate the World Cup seedings.

But I digress. The purpose of this rant was questioning why we are so biased against the U.S.A. I, for one, was rooting
for them. I was quite impressed with their play thus far, against all odds. Twice they were denied goals that would have
given them victories and cemented their dominance of their group. And yet they prevailed. I’ve always been one to side with
an underdog and found one in the U.S. I was quite impressed by how they relentlessly pushed on and ended at the top of their
group. But, as I mentioned before, Saturday’s game is a conflicting one for me. Being as to the match being against Ghana,
the last remaining African team. In the first ever World Cup hosted by an African nation. Which, I might add, has done an
impeccable job hosting, to make any and all Africans proud.

So for this game, I will remain unbiased and will take equal joy in either team advancing. But I will pledge my allegiance to
whomever is to move on and will wholeheartedly support them the rest of the way!
