        'Yebelwachew’ ('Let them beat them’) they went on to explain, expressing their joy of such an outcome.
        This astounded him even more and he asked why they would want such a fate for the nation that they now
        live in. A nation they came to with free will, looking for a better future for themselves and their families.
        Such is the case for most, if not all refugees here. To the best of my knowledge, there are no refugees forced
        to live here. There are several that were forced to leave their native lands due to political instabilities,
        lack of opportunities, etc. But none that were forced by U.S. to relocate here. So why the relentless desire
        to see them fail?

This is only a friendly competition in the single biggest stage of them all. No policies are set here. No western
governments to impede the growth of smaller nations. No use of incomparable force to subdue weaker nations. This is
just a game. If it is a matter of us against the powerful western world, then why does Europe enjoy such fanfare from
Africans? Why are we so quick to pick European teams as our own? 'I’m rooting for Italy’… 'Germany is my team’…
'England all the way!!’. Really? If anything, shouldn’t we Africans be anti-Europe? The continent that had for generations
colonized Africa and have direct responsibility for Africa current dismal state? Should we not be aligned against them? And
if not for historical and political reasons, how about how they unfairly dominate the World Cup placements? 8 countries from
the Americas… 6 from Africa… 3 from Asia… none from the Middle East and an astounding 13 from Europe!! How much more biased
can the World Cup be? I’m ecstatic that only 6 now remain and whole heartedly root for any team that can knock out another
European team. I was beside myself when France and Italy were knocked out in the first round. I am now excitedly awaiting the
Germany v. England and Spain v. Portugal games, for I know that 2 more European team are destined to go home!
