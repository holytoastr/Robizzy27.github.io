        My cousin shared an experience with me that had him quite perplexed. He was at work watching the
        U.S. v. Slovenia game with a bunch of his American co-workers in the cafeteria. The vast majority
        of the people the people watching were Americans, except for 2 young ladies from Ethiopia, who
        worked in the cafeteria. The mood was quite electric until Slovenia scored the first goal to take
        the lead. The crowd was quite deflated and seemed to have the collective wind knocked out of them as
        their hopes of advancing to the next round seemed to be hanging by a thread. Except for the 2 young
        ladies, who seemed unable to control their elation and screamed out with joy. They relished at the
        opportunity to give each other high fives and celebrate loudly in the now dejected silence of the
        cafeteria. He could only watch in shock as they seemed to take joy in the annoyance of the mostly
        American crowd. Now, had this been the Ghana v. U.S. game, I can understand and somewhat justify their
        actions. After all, it is a fellow African nation. The last remaining one at that. In the first ever
        World Cup hosted by an African nation. But that wasn’t the case. It was Slovenia. A nation few outside
        of Slovenia had ever heard of. A nation with no ties to Africa, let alone our native Ethiopia. So why
        the elation? Why so much joy at the prospect of them defeating the U.S., a nation that they reside in?

        As the game wore on and Slovenia scored again, they again were unable to contain themselves and danced
        around with joy ululating as if their future depended on it. My cousin approached them and inquired as
        to why they were taking such joy in this now seeming downfall of the U.S. team. Did they have relatives
        in Slovenia? Did they have a vested interest in their victory? A bet perhaps? To which they replied ‘No’.
        They had never heard of the country before that day. They barely had any interest in Soccer as a whole.
        They just relished the joy of watching the Americans fans so dejected at the prospect of their World Cup
        dreams coming to an end.
